Tired of swiping? Let the people who actually know you play matchmaker. Your friends find someone, write a personal pitch, and if you both say yes — you connect.

## Description

**Your friends have been dying to set you up. Now they finally can.**

You Two Should Meet is the anti-dating app. No swiping, no algorithms, no endless scrolling through strangers. Instead, you invite the friends who know you best to be your matchmakers — and they do what they've been wanting to do all along: find you someone great.

**Here's how it works:**

1. Tell us what you're looking for
Sign up, share your preferences, and invite the friends who know your type better than you do. Each one gets a personal link.

2. Your friends find someone
Your matchmakers think of someone perfect for you. They write a personal pitch — who this person is, what makes them special, and why they think you'd click.

3. Both say yes, you connect
The person your friend recommended gets a text with the pitch. If you're both interested, you get each other's number. That's it. Real connection, powered by real friendship.

**Why it works:**

Every introduction on You Two Should Meet comes from someone who knows you both. That's a better filter than any algorithm could ever be. Your friends know your sense of humor, your values, what makes you light up — and they know someone who matches.

**Built on trust, not tricks:**

- No swiping — every match is personal
- No algorithms — just friends who care
- No ads — we're not selling your attention
- No endless scrolling — meet someone and delete the app

Dating apps optimize for engagement. We optimize for the moment you don't need us anymore.

**Your matchmakers earn points and badges** for every great match they make. The better the connection, the higher they climb. It's a little friendly competition to see who's the best matchmaker in the group.

Download You Two Should Meet and let your friends do what they do best.
